# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We haven't reached 1.0 yet sooooooooooooo... (it's supported).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulerability in Proton, you create a report in the issues tab. We will work towards fixing the security issue (it can take some time, from personal experience).
