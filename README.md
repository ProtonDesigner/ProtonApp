<p style="text-align:center;">Simple prototyping and designing software for teams.</p>

## Developing/Running
There are currently no prebuilt binaries for Proton, so you have to do it yourself. If you want, you can setup `electron-builder` to build the app yourself, but I'd rather just run it directly, especially if you are developing the app.

Instuctions can be found [here](/tree/master/web).
