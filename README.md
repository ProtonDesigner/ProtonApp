## Developing/Running
There are currently no prebuilt binaries for Proton, so you have to do it yourself. If you want, you can setup `electron-builder` to build the app yourself, but I'd rather just run it directly, especially if you are developing the app.

Instuctions can be found [here](/web).

## Changelog
Random notes from random days on random weekends (did I tell you it's random?).

2022-12-04 (December 4th, 2022): Partly finished settings, did some modifications to some files, `App.js` now applies dark mode to the entire app, and other things you can look at in the commits :D

2022-12-11 (December 11th, 2022): Settings is still not completed. I've added a kinda working code editor and plan to add a file explorer type thing on the side. Not too much progress other than that this weekend because I was taking a bit of a break, played some Geometry Dash, made and verified my best and hardest challenge to date, proceeded to get 49% on "B" (the medium demon) and built a Geode mod for the game. Yeahhhh. And other things you can look at in the commits :D
